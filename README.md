Traditional Methods for Analysis of Animal Navigation
<ul>
  <li></br><b>Plotting:</b>
<li>DSFMD_PGPS_PLOT_GROUP.R -  Example for using leaflet for interactive display of GPS tracks by Group
<li>DSFMD_PGPS_PLOT_INDIVIDUAL.R -  Example for using leaflet for interactive display of GPS tracks by Individual
<li>DSFMD_PGPS_PLOT_REPEATED.R -  Example for using leaflet to plot repeated flights (including offsite releases)
  <li></br><b>Basic Measurements:</b>
<li>DSFMD_PGPS_TRAD.R - Example implementation for calculation of traditional measurements for GPS data (e.g. efficiency, flight speed vanishing bearings)
<li>DSFMD_PGPS_REPCMP.R - Example implementation for calculation for comparing repeated flights (inlcuding nearest neighbour distance, normalized mutual information, angular prediction error)
